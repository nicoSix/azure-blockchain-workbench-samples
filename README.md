# Refrigerated Supply Chain samples

## Overview 

This repository hosts the Refrigerated Supply Chain code samples for the [End-to-End Blockchain Solution - Refrigerated Supply Chain guide](./End-to-End Blockchain Solution - Refrigered Supply Chain Sample.pdf).

The main objective of this guide is to show you how to implement an end-to-end solution based on a real scenario, which will capitalize on Azure Blockchain Workbench to reveal its full potential: refrigerated transportation of products. 

You will learn to deploy the Blockchain Workbench (on an existing Ethereum network or a new network), implement an IoT part with multiple physical connected devices, link the solution with Azure Active Directory for identity management and finally learn how to integrate new services into the solution (Dynamics 365, Outlook, React web application, ...).

## Repository content

- [Integration](./Integration): contains the React web app which interacts with Azure Blockchain Workbench. 
- [IoT setup](./IoT setup): contains every code sample for the devices introduced inside the guide.
